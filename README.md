# AMU QnA Survey

> A VueJS 2 site to collect queries and their answers into Firebase Database

## Introduction

We thought of learning machine learning (machine learning machine learning ... ), and help so want to create an AI bot using Tensorflow. But, we don't have enough data :sad:, the major requirement to train any model. So we take our requests to you. Send us common queries and their answers related to your college and AMU and we may be able to build the first university AI bot in UP? India? World?. All depends on how we are able to get results.  
Thank You
